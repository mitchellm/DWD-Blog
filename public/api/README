API README
====================================

===============
Making a request:
===============
The API accepts async POST requests with only one mandatory parameter: "request".
The requests have to be listed in the api/index.php

The request parameter determines where in the API to route the call. For example, if you send a post request with the following information:
url: API_INDEX
form data: {request:login, email:abc@website.com, password:password}
TYPE: POST

EXAMPLE JQERU CODE THAT DOES THIS:
$.ajax({
    type: 'POST',
    data: 'request=login&email=' + email + '&password=' + password,
    url: pathToHandler + 'index.php',
    async: true,
    success: function (data) {
        $('div#login').append('<br />' + data);
    },
    error: function () {
        alert("an error has occured!");
    }
});

The demo folder has two forms that work using jquery dom manipulation+ajax calls to log you in and register your account through the api.


===============
After sending a request, the API will produce a response. 
===============

Possible responses:
In situations where a simple success/failure response will work, it will just return 0 or 1.

0 = FAILURE
1 = SUCCESS 

For things with a wide arrange of possible errors or outputs (such as registration), the API will return a json encoded array of all errors 
encountered/whatever needs to be made known that you can represent through the GUI.

Responses can be catered to the intended feature if you just let me know what you want it to return from the database.

ERROR EXPLANATION
===============

If a request is not pre-configured in the API, you will recieve a response: Request not found in host file-system OR not whitelisted.

If the request is malformed when it hits the API, you will recieve a list of boolean codes. The key is here:
A=Was the SERVER property "HTTP X REQUESTED WITH" set? (Header that is used to determine if ajax call is valid)
B=HTTP X REQUESTED WITH set to "XMLHttpRequest" (validates that it is a true ajax call)
C=Was a request parsed from the request sent to the api?
D=Value of the request sent to API
